**A selenium-based bot that checks the COWIN website every minute for vaccine availability in your area. When a vaccine is found, it will shout &quot;Vaccine Found!&quot; 10 times out of joy.**

Steps to run the bot:

1. Download and open the Jupyter notebook in any environment.
2. Install Selenium python. [Run &#39;python pip install selenium&#39; in selenium]
3. Check your Chrome version and download an appropriate webdriver for it from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
4. In the editor, change the path to the webdriver. [Block 1, Line 7]
5. Double check the path to the webdriver. [On running Block 1, COWIN website should open up in a Selenium controlled version of Chrome]
6. Change your pincode and run the block. [Block 2, Line 5]
7. Run the third block.
